5	9416.json	false	Says when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die.	guns	jim-rubens	Small business owner	New Hampshire	republican	1	1	0	1	0	in an interview at gun shop in Hudson, N.H.	Rubens said when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2. 5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die. One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees its logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2. 33 and 14. Overall, this statement is not accurate.

He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee. But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago. There, the case is much more difficult to make. When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs.  Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio. But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme. The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue. In that case, Crist's flip-flopping helps his argument.

We dont know what he had in mind. Overall, Fosters point that the NCAA and colleges get a lot more out of the deal than the players is accurate. His specifics, however, are off.

And, as he says, the budget eliminates in the second year all one-time money except $100 million. Though debate still exists over the exact figure of one-time money used in the last budget cycle, the level of one-time money used was unprecedented and is clearly far greater than what is proposed in the new budget. Amstutz statement is accurate and theres nothing significantly missing for a full understanding.

Regardless of the accuracy of the analysis, it spoke to the experience of a small minority of Americans, and it did not factor in the subsidies that will cushion some people from increased premiums. Hannity overreached in his remarks on radio. That said, new rules for insurance plans will tend to push some rates up -- because the plans must provide better coverage. But by how much depends on a host of factors that several leading health policy experts say is too difficult to estimate.

"Allen, trying to refute charges he voted to run up federal deficits, said the U. S.  was ""on a trajectory towards a balanced budget"" when he left the Senate in 2007. Allens campaign cites a 2007 CBO report that said Washington was on the road to budget surpluses, starting in 2012. But those projections were based on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would end as scheduled in 2010. And Allen has maintained since at least 2006 that the tax reductions should be made permanent. Had Allen prevailed on the tax cuts, figures in the 2007 CBO report point to the deficit slowly rising in raw dollars over the next eight years. The deficit, as a percentage of GDP, would have been only a smidgen lower in 2015 than it was in 2007. So Allen is right that the U. S.  was projected to be on a trajectory towards a balanced budget when his Senate term ended. But he omits a key detail that creates a different impression: the projected path towards a balanced budget required a step Allen refused to take -- ending the Bush tax cuts."

277	4261.json	false	High-speed rail would have cost Florida taxpayers $1 billion to build.	transportation	rick-scott	Governor	Florida	republican	28	23	38	34	7	TV interview	If high-speed rail had moved ahead in Florida, Scott said the state would have had to pay $1 billion to build it. While the study correctly points out that other transportation projects have experienced cost overruns, there are several flaws with the study. Most importantly, the study assumes that the state would pay for cost overruns. But that ignores that both the state official in charge of the rail project and the U. S.  Department of Transportation secretary said that the state wouldn't be liable for overruns. And legislators were keen on having it happen that way before fully embracing the high-speed rail line. In the end, the state's share to build the line would have been capped at around $280 million (and legislators hoped the final number would be even less). You can't rewrite history to fit your narrative.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns goes a step further in saying Wolf ""voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns.

Rick Scott told national television audiences that the expansion would cost Florida $1. 9 billion a year. The most recent estimate from the state health care agency says a series of changes to Medicaid could wind up costing about $1. 4 billion a year, but that number includes things beyond the expansion to Medicaid that Scott was talking about. For instance, about $400 million is tied to increased reimbursement payments to Medicaid providers. But the state isn't required to pay that out. And another estimated $516 million will pay for people who are eligible for Medicaid under its current provisions but have not enrolled. They would remain eligible whether or not the program is expanded in Florida. That leaves about $500 million in estimated new costs for Medicaid patients under the federal government expansion. And that cost would not fully kick in until 2020. So yes, the Medicaid expansion will cost the state.

"Perry said Texas has the nations third-highest high school graduation rate, which he called a significant turnaround from a few years ago. Texas tied with five states for the third-highest rate in 2011, of 86 percent. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked. Other nicks in Perrys statement: These results are preliminary and might prove unreliable. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Finally, since it's not accurate to compare these rates devised in different ways, Perrys reference to a ""significant turnaround"" depends on just the three years of rates measured in the newest way. But in this time window, there is no indication the rate was either stuck or plummeting before 2011, so the latest results do not indicate a turnaround. All told, Texas graduation rates are improving and the state looks strong compared to most others."

Looking at individual polls, the lead might shift less often, but the window on the race those polls offer is not as detailed as the method Rove used. There might be minor quibbles about the exact tally, but Rove was in the ballpark.

McAuliffe said that the General Assemblys refusal to expand Medicaid would send Virginia taxpayers money into 27 other states to insure their working poor. Hes right that 27 states have broadened Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. And if Virginia doesnt join suit, it will sacrifice federal dollars that would pay the overwhelming long-term cost of the expansion. Virginians, like residents of all states, are subject to new taxes to help support the ACA. The payments pour into the U. S.  Treasury where they are mixed with other tax dollars and piped out to federal programs. Theres no tracking of individual coins in this flow of money and its possible that some deposits from Virginia could end up helping Medicaid recipients in other states. But contrary to McAuliffes statement, theres no direct connection between Virginias decision on expansion and what happens to Medicaid in other states. The goal of expansion is to offer Medicaid insurance to people earning up 133 percent of the U. S.  poverty line. States participating in the program will receive the same federal subsidy for each new enrollee regardless of whether Virginia participates.

Two more universities expect students to attend community college first but pay a total of $10,372 or less at both institutions. That leaves seven universities that expect students to earn their $10,000 degrees after corraling up to 87 college credits in other ways that presumably cost additional money. Several also require students following the $10,000 degree plans to have income-based Pell grants or to qualify for other scholarships.

907	5713.json	barely-true	Women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama.	corrections-and-updates,jobs,women	mitt-romney	Former governor	Massachusetts	republican	34	32	58	33	19	Mitt Romney's website	"Romney's website said that women account for 92. 3 percent of jobs lost under Obama. By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against womens job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92. 3 percent. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector. ""To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment,"" Bartlett said. ""The decline . . . has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions. ""This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women. Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40. 5 percent of all state and local government job losses. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Womens Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington Universitys public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E.  Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that ""theres a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost. ""If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector. ""That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the presidents stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in ""emergency aid"" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it. ""You could hardly blame Obama for that,"" Appelbaum said. As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. The Associated Press said using the 92. 3 percent figure as a measure of Obamas record on women was ""dubious at best. ""First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: ""Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers? ""And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring ""under Obama. """"Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr.  Bush nor Mr.  Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney,"" Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog. Well conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said its fair to fault Obama for that. ""I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery,"" Wall said. ""I dont give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that. But they own the recovery. ""Does all this mean that Obamas policies have brought hard times to women"

McCall said he doesnt know if Straus knew about the  pro-Homer ad. Upshot:  The radio spot wasnt aired by the Republicans, as Barton puts it, and  only one Republican voice -- McCalls -- was heard. Also, Straus wasnt  House speaker when the ad aired in 2008, so he had no lieutenants. But the GOP members  Barton named have proven to be Straus allies. And they earlier joined  hands in a radio ad for Homer, their Democratic colleague.

But looking at the numbers of waivers that have been given to both union and non-union groups, we dont see any pattern that would support a case for special treatment. The number of waivers are a small sample of all health plans, and many more waivers were given to big companies and corporations. But there are additional problems with the ad. The ad doesnt mention that the waivers only apply to annual coverage limits, that theyre intended to be in place only until 2014 and that many for-profit companies have received the same waivers. It gives the impression that unions are entirely exempt from the health care law, which they are not.

The report says the ratio is useful for comparing different states and countries. In an interview, Moodys analyst Nicole Johnson said that a relatively low ratio generally means a state has more flexibility to increase its debt than states with high ratios. So, Texas has the least state debt per capita among the most populous states, as Perry says, and by Moodys accounting the 12th lowest of all states. Perry incorrectly said it was fourth-lowest of all states, but his meaning holds up; Texas is a relatively low-debt state.

In some cities, police officers do jobs that are performed by civilian personnel elsewhere. Some police departments have fewer officers because other local law enforcement agencies, like a sheriffs office, pick up slack. It's even trickier to compare agencies with such different duties as the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department, as Dewhurst did.

It was introduced in the House in 2005, though Kucinich supported an earlier version during his previous run for president in 2004. It would provide free health care for all, including primary care, prescription drugs, and mental health services. The plan would be paid for by cost savings and tax increases on the top 5 percent of income earners, an increased payroll tax, and taxes on stock and bond transactions. The legislation has little chance of passing, but it's still fairly specific and it's certainly universal.

We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close. The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government. To the contrary, the administration has moved to widen the mandates exemption for religious employers and provide a workaround for those who act as their own insurance providers -- with the goal of allowing affected parties to continue their work without violating or changing their beliefs.

According to calculations by Whitehouses office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16. 72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16. 79 percent. In short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS's most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report. When we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he's right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does.

In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judges order in response said Lowes should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasnt rooted in letting Lowes dump -- or stopping Lowes from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance."

In the end, the number of jobs lost cited in Portmans June 30 statement is inflated and not close enough to be considered a difference that can be attributed to rounding. Furthermore, while the campaign is correct that jobs have been lost since the stimulus was passed, its release ignores important context: Ohio has started to see net job gains in recent months, albeit small, contradicting a suggestion that the stimulus bill is causing job losses.

Some of Obamas biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obamas share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term. This doesnt change the facts or statistics as stated by Portman: The Obama administration has put out ""more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times."
1243	2642.json	barely-true	Says Marco Rubio sold a home to a chiropractor who had been lobbying him on automobile insurance legislation and once he sold the home, for $380,000 cash, the speakers position on the issue changed.	ethics	charlie-crist		Florida	democrat	15	9	20	19	2	a Leadership Florida/Florida Press Association debate	"This is an interesting case study in politics. Let's start by stating the obvious. Rubio would have been better off selling his house to someone other than the mother of a chiropractor who was trying to get him to extend personal injury protection. But, other than perception, there are no obvious glaring red flags about the sale. He got a good price, it seems, but not an outrageous one based on the comparable sales we examined. Also, the cash sale doesn't bother us particularly. This is a retiree who had money from a life insurance policy. As for Rubio's position on the PIP laws, he initially said he would let the mandate expire unless fraud reforms were included. Some were included in the legislation proposed by the Senate, but apparently not enough to sway Rubio. So the session ended in May 2007 without action, despite the house sale. Rubio and House leaders then worked to include additional fraud protections and were able to reach a deal more to their liking. Rubio, in fact, called to include PIP legislation during a special session. The ultimate bill that passed included a few more anti-fraud measures, but seems not to have stopped much fraud, according to state statistics. We're not sure why it took five extra months to include the minor changes to the PIP legislation, or why House leaders didn't propose the changes during the session. Crist condensed the facts when he said that the chiropractor lobbying Rubio bought the house. It was the chiropractor's mother who made the purchase. He also condensed the timeline and slightly manipulated the chain of events when he said, ""once he sold the home . . . the speaker's position on the issue changed. ""We think there's at least a debate on whether he changed his position at all. Rubio never said he opposed extending PIP. He said he opposed extending it without proper protections against fraud. A version of the bill proposed during a 2007 special legislative session emerged that included fraud protectionshe wanted."

""Perhaps no one used those exact words (though the report itself had a pretty strongly worded ""conclusion"" section). That sounds pretty conclusive to us.
